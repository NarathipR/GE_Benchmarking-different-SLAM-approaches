# SLAM-output trajectory fusion

## Overview
This project builds on the [main repository](../README.md). It focuses on exploring methods to generate a better trajectory output based on metrics like APE/RPE - this is an offline fusion attempt and thus can be used once tests on datasets are done with a trajectory ready. 

## Usage
To be updated

## License
This project follows the same license as the [main repository](../LICENSE).
